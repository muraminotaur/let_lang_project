## How to run

```go run *.go```

#### Notes

I understand this conceptually and in practice, however these past two weeks have been incredibly difficult for me after switching medication and the passing of a friend. I did not have enough time to work out final small issues in the code to get it to display the parts necessary. All of the code is there and complete, I just couldn't make time to iron out the smaller issues. I hope that I can be graded on what I have.
